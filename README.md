# Rode Clone-With Tailwind

- I have made my Third Tailwind CSS project , which is Rode clone just using Tailwind CSS. It is mobile responsive, I have added some hovering effects to it and I have added the original shopify links which will redirect you to the original website. I learned a lot about Tailwind by making this project.

- It took me 1 day to complete this project.
